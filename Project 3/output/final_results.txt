    After the private bail hearing in London, the woman's solicitor, Mike Tait, said the judge had taken the view that she should be given the 'maximum chance' **to** prove herself as a mother. If she succeeded, she would be eligible for admission **to** a **prison** mother-and-baby unit after her appearance on the robbery charge, for which she stood **to** receive a substantial custodial sentence. The judge had said that bail would not normally be appropriate in such a case, but the birth of the baby had transformed the situation and the mother seemed determined **to** bond with her baby. Last night the woman, identified only as 'L', was **to** have been transferred **to** Holloway from the Whittington Hospital in North London where she and the baby have been cared for since the birth on December 28.

    AN AXE monster who slaughtered a charity worker and her two lovers in scenes of 'unimaginable savagery' was jailed for life yesterday. Drug-crazed Alan Hobbs 32, was caged three times over for butchering pretty Gillian Harvey and the two men over a 24-hour period. A court heard how he flipped after Gillian taunted him about sex at her rented bedsit - stabbing and hacking her **to** death with a knife and two chisels. Then, when unsuspecting Ian Brown and Peter Smith called separately at the flat, he took them both prisoner. Ian, who arrived first, was held hostage overnight, only having his bonds loosened **to** use the toilet and be fed cheese on toast and a cup of tea. When Peter turned up next morning Hobbs bound and gagged the terrified pair together on the bed, even tying them **to** a bicycle. Finally he hacked them **to** pieces with 30 blows from an 18in axe - with one forced **to** helplessly watch the other being killed first. Horrified police who broke into the house a week later found it swarming with flies and blood splashed 6ft up the walls. Prosecutor Mr Adrian Redgrave, QC, told Reading Crown Court:"The accused murdered three friends over 24 hours, all in the same house, in circumstances of almost unimaginable savagery and callousness." Convicted armed robber Hobbs - who had admitted he was a walking timebomb - hadsex with long-time friend Gillian, 30, while full of amphetamines and booze. Police believe it was his failure **to** perform a second time that led her **to** makea sarcastic comment about his sexual prowess - triggering the frenzy of murder. He had previously been friends not only with Gillian but both Ian, 36, and Peter, 31, the three of whom openly shared an odd sexual triangle relationship. Mr Redgrave said: "He had sexual intercourse with Gillian and then he killed her. "Later that evening when her boyfriend Mr Brown arrived the accused bound and gagged him and held him prisoner. "He kept Mr Brown **prisoner** until the next day, sleeping in the house that night.
    Despite Hobbs drug-fuelled rage he showed bizarre humane touches including letting his victim go **to** the loo and making him tea. Hobbs told detectives later he was planning **to** leave the flat when Peter suddenly arrived. He was beaten with the blunt end of an axe that was kept in the house before beingroped **to** Ian. A police source said: "Mr Smith had managed **to** almost get his hands untied and escape. When Hobbs realised what was happening he grabbed the axe and, using overarm strokes as if he was chopping wood, hacked into the pair of them. "They were chopped **to** bits with approximately 15 blows **to** each body." After the killings on the last weekend of August last year, Hobbs fled **to** his sister Colleen's house in Basingstoke, Hants.
